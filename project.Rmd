## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Load Data

```{r}
adult <- read.table("adult.data", sep = ",")
colnames(adult) <- c("age", "workclass", "fnlwgt", "education", "education_num", "marital_status", "occupation", "relationship", "race", "sex", "capital_gain", "capital_loss", "hours_per_week", "native_country", "50k")
adult
```
```{r}
summary(adult)
```

```{r}
m1 <- lm(age ~ capital_gain, data = adult)
summary(m1)
plot(m1)
```
